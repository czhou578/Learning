- don't use h1 as alternative for logo, not going to help with seo
- "role" in ul, some screen readers want to treat it as a list for accessibility

- even columns has two divs inside, one for left box (bring everyone etc...) and one for the 89.74% box

- alt for imgs, important or decorative?

- visual style doesn't correspond to element you should be using in that case
- data attribute on buttons, what for?
- aria-label for screenreaders
