shift + alt + down arrow to duplicate selected code
ctrl + shift + L to create multiple cursors at places where the selected code matches

- don't use h1 as alternative for logo, not going to help with seo
- "role" in ul, some screen readers want to treat it as a list for accessibility

- even columns has two divs inside, one for left box (bring everyone etc...) and one for the 89.74% box

- alt for imgs, important or decorative?

- visual style doesn't correspond to element you should be using in that case
- data attribute on buttons, what for?
- aria-label for screenreaders (generally yes is better)

use em in media queries because that makes zoom in/out consistent across all browsers, em looks at browser default setting, and not root font size

1fr unit:

use "|" in html to separate utility from component classes only

.button[data-type="inverted"]

focus:visible on button
line-height 1 to center things...

Responsiveness Notes:

- spacing utility classes??
- aria controls -> what does this element control?
